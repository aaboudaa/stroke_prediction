# stroke_prediction

## Description
This machine learning project is dedicated to predicting the likelihood of stroke occurrence based on various patient attributes and health indicators. This project utilizes data analysis and predictive modeling to assist in identifying individuals at a higher risk of suffering a stroke.

## Key Steps and Insights:

**1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing:** The project begins with data exploration and preprocessing, including handling missing values and encoding categorical features.

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations and statistical analysis are employed to gain insights into the dataset. Notable EDA includes age distribution comparisons for stroke and non-stroke cases, gender-based stroke occurrence, and examination of class imbalances.

**3. Data Balancing:** Given the class imbalance in the dataset, the project employs the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to balance the data, ensuring that the predictive model isn't skewed.

**4. Model Building:** A logistic regression model is chosen for predicting stroke occurrence. The model is trained on the preprocessed and balanced dataset.

**5. Model Evaluation:** The project evaluates the model's performance using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, ROC-AUC score, and confusion matrices. Cross-validation is applied to ensure robustness.

## Dataset 
The project utilizes a dataset containing patient information, including age, gender, marital status, work type, and health-related attributes. These attributes serve as features to predict the binary outcome of stroke occurrence.

## Usage
* Healthcare professionals and researchers can utilize this project to assess and predict stroke risk for patients, aiding in timely interventions and prevention.
* Data scientists and machine learning enthusiasts can explore the codebase to understand data preprocessing, class balancing, and model evaluation techniques in the context of healthcare data.
